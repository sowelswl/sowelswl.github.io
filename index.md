# About Me

<img src="https://sowelswl.github.io/weilisong.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Weili Song (宋伟力)**.

I am a PhD candidate in Management Science and Engineering at Hunan University, specializing in **Financial Risk Management** and **Quantitative Finance**. I hold a Master's degree in Statistics from the Australian National University and have a background in **Quantitative Strategy Research** from various internships. I have experience in applying **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques in financial data analysis, particularly achieving significant results in **Factor Mining** and **Portfolio Optimization**. My research goal is to combine advanced financial models with real-world data to improve risk-adjusted returns.

Recently, I participated in a research project called AlphaForge\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18394}{AlphaForge}, which proposed an innovative framework for mining and dynamically combining formulaic Alpha factors. This research aims to address the challenges of financial data complexity and market dynamics, enhancing the performance and interpretability of quantitative investments through advanced machine learning techniques.
