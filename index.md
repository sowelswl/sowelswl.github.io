# About Me

<img src="https://sowelswl.github.io/weilisong.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Weili Song (宋伟力)**.

I am a PhD candidate in Management Science and Engineering at Hunan University, specializing in **Quantitative Finance** and **Financial Risk Management**, while also working part-time as a quantitative researcher at a private equity fund. I hold a Master's degree in Statistics from the Australian National University and have accumulated rich experience in **Quantitative Strategy Research** through various work practices. I am passionate about quantitative investment research aimed at **live trading**, dedicated to closely combining theory with practice and continuously exploring innovative investment strategies.

## Live Trading Product

In collaboration with my partner at the private equity fund (a team of two), we dedicated ourselves to researching quantitative stock selection strategies from 2022 to 2023. We officially launched our CSI 500 Index enhancement product for live trading on October 22, 2023. Over the past 10 months of operation, our product has achieved the following results:

- A significant excess return of <span style="color: red;">**21.90%**</span> relative to the CSI 500 Index
- Far surpassing the industry average (the average excess return of CSI 500 enhancement products from large-scale quantitative private equity funds over the past year was only <span style="color: red;">**8%**</span>)
- Achieved an excellent excess Sharpe ratio of <span style="color: red;">**2.398**</span>

Characteristics of our trading strategy:

- Stock selection pool covers the entire market, with an average holding of 300-500 stocks
- Employs intraday medium to low-frequency signals, without the participation of intraday high-frequency round-trip trading signals, not falling under the category of high-frequency trading closely monitored by regulatory authorities
- Annualized two-way turnover rate of approximately **30-50** times, with large capital capacity

During the quantitative stock market crash in February 2024, our performance:

- Maximum excess drawdown was only <span style="color: red;">**7.98%**</span> (the average maximum excess drawdown of CSI 500 enhancement products from large-scale quantitative private equity funds over the past year was as high as <span style="color: red;">**11%**</span>)
- Recovered from the excess drawdown in just <span style="color: red;">**10 trading days**</span> (the average recovery time for CSI 500 enhancement products from large-scale quantitative private equity funds was as long as <span style="color: red;">**5 months**</span>)
